==HARDWARE==

--Drive Base--
[ ]  transmission needs fixing
[ ]  too hard to get blocks - intakes

--Lift--
[ ]  Lift string jumping winder
[ ]  lift switch wire getting pulled
[ ]  lift wobbly when moving
[ ]  claws held up with friction even though lift is down

--Claws--

==SOFTWARE==

[X]  Program ending issues - software problem (solved by tech support question 1)
[X]  button for claws pressed multiple times per "press"

not sure about the progress on the hardware stuff
